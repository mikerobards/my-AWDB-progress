### Day 10 & 11: December 14 & 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started Section 6: Async Foundations.

**Thoughts**: Learning some CS foundations regarding asynchronous JS stuff. Not terribly exciting. Did an exercise where Tim asked us to write out a function that would perform what the findIndex function does. I got close. Then an exercise to write a countDown timer function using setInterval and clearInterval. I got it, but not perfectly. Learned clearInterval needs a variable passed in it.

**Today's Progress**: Finished Section 6: Async Foundations. Started Section 7: AJAX Part 1: XHR and Fetch

### Day 17: December 21, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Section 9: Testing with Jasmine. Started Section 10: Advanced Array Methods.

**Thoughts**: Unit testing with Jasmine. Not much hands on. Some relatively easy quizes. I probably need to practice some unit testing on my own. But preferrably with .NET. Finished forEach section. Elie has us doing coding challenges a la FCC. It's good. I got them all working! More of this to come in this section. Ok whatever more JS!

### Day 18-20: December 21-23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Section 10: Advanced Array Methods.

**Thoughts**: Elie going deep in array methods. After each one (almost), he had coding challenges. Some were easy, some took a while. I got them all except for the last reduce cuz I gotta do house stuff before Xmas. But hey I learned a lot! Def more comfortable with these than I was before.
