### Day 1: December 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started the course. Finished Section 1: Course Introduction. Started Section 2: CSS Animations: Transforms and Transitions. Finished through Lesson 20.

**Thoughts**: It's good to be back with Colt. I really like his learning style! I am learning a lot, and am eager to test out these skills on some real projects! CodePen boo.
