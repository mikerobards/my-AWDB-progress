### Day 10 & 11: December 14 & 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started Section 6: Async Foundations.

**Thoughts**: Learning some CS foundations regarding asynchronous JS stuff. Not terribly exciting. Did an exercise where Tim asked us to write out a function that would perform what the findIndex function does. I got close. Then an exercise to write a countDown timer function using setInterval and clearInterval. I got it, but not perfectly. Learned clearInterval needs a variable passed in it.
