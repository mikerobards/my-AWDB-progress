### Day 21-23: December 24-26, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Working on Section 11: Closures and the Keyword 'this'

**Thoughts**: Closures. Blah! They suck. But I need to learn them. Only two challenges, and had to look up the answers on both. Oh well. Will work on getting my head around this. Keep working at it!
